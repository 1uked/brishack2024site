            <div class="faqs">
                <h3>I'm inexperienced as a programmer, can I still participate?</h3>
                <p>Of course! Participating in a Hackathon is a great way to get more experience; you can either join a
                    team of more experienced participants and learn from them, or participate yourself and grow from the
                    challenge, and hopefully even gain an awesome portfolio piece by the end of the Hackathon.</p>
                <p>Remember, it isn't all about winning; BrisHack is a fun event for you to learn and explore new
                    technologies and areas!</p>
                <h3>I don't attend the University of Bristol, can I participate?</h3>
                <p>As long as you are a student aged over eighteen at a university or college in the UK, you are welcome
                    to join!</p>
                <h3>Will food be provided?</h3>
                <p>We're offended you even asked; we always have food! Just make sure to let us know if you have any
                    dietary requirements!</p>
                <h3>I don't study a STEM discipline, can I participate?</h3>
                <p>BrisHack is open to all! If you have even basic technological knowledge, we'd love to see what you
                    make. Alternatively, if you lack technological powress but have an awesome idea, perhaps you can
                    join a team and be their ideas-person</p>
                <h3>Do I need to dream up a solution to a huge/very serious problem?</h2>
                    <p>You don't need to solve a huge problem; progress comes in small nudges! If you think you've got
                        the cure to world hunger, that's awesome! But don't be put off entering because you are tackling
                        a small issue; oftentimes it's the focussed solutions that are the most effective.</p>
